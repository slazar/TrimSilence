TrimSilence.ny
==============

Modifications to TrimSilence.ny by Steve Daulton. I added fields to keep silence at the beginning and the end of the sound. You can specify how much sound to leave at the beginning or the end of the sound, in seconds. If you want to leave 250ms at the beginning and the end, for example, you can put 0.250 in the "Leave at start" and "Leave at end" values. It keeps the original silence, so if you have issues with beginning or end sounds getting cut off, this can help.

To install, put the TrimSilence.ny in your Audacity plug-ins folder.
